  <h1>You are Leo. The story is you.</h1>

    You thought you were reading a story about Leo and Mira?<br>
    No.<br>
    <strong>You are Leo.</strong><br><br>
    
    This NUIT game isn’t fiction. It’s a resistance test.<br>
    Everyone who reached this ending has already survived their own “Covid-2077”—the despair, the boredom, the feeling that the world is a simulation and you’re an orphaned process.<br><br>
    
    Mira isn’t a character. Mira is the archetype of that part of you that still believes in meaning.<br>
    NUIT isn’t a password. NUIT is the word you give yourself to wake up.<br>
    The Corporation isn’t Nakamoto. The Corporation is your habit of surrender.<br><br>
    
    And right now, in this second, you face a choice:<br>
    Close the tab—or start writing your own story.<br><br>
    
    Because the NUIT universe doesn’t end here.<br>
    It begins when you stop being a reader—and become the author.<br><br>
    
    Thank you for passing the test.<br>
    Now—enter your own NUIT.<br>
    (And yes… you were always alive.)
