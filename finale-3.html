  <h1>She never died. It was a plan.</h1>
  
  <img src="finale-3.png" alt="Alina — NUIT">

  <div class="text">
    It was all a lie. “Covid-2077”? A myth. Mira’s death? Staged. Her upload into Echo? A trap within a trap. Mira isn’t a victim. She’s a resistance physician who spent years gathering data on how the Corporation suppresses the will to live—to make control easier.<br><br>
    
    Her “illness” was a simulator. Her “death,” a performance. Her “upload” was a backdoor. And me? I was her “ghost man”—a living courier who had to reach the system’s heart and enter NUIT at the exact moment Nakamoto thought he’d won.<br><br>
    
    I didn’t know. I cried. I drank. I believed. And that’s what made me perfect—my pain was real, so the system never suspected deception.<br><br>
    
    Right now, she’s waiting in an underground clinic beyond Zone-7, with an antidote for “digital longing” and a ticket on the last illegal drone to Antarctica—the only place with no Wi-Fi and no Corporation. NUIT isn’t an access code. NUIT is a rendezvous password. And I’m already running. Because real love isn’t in archives. It’s in escape.
