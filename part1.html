<h1>The Ghost in the Code: A 2077 Story - Part I</h1>
  <!-- Картинка сверху -->
  <img src="part1.png" alt="Alina — NUIT">

  
  <div class="subtitle">2077. The world runs on algorithms. Humanity runs on nostalgia.</div>

  <p>
    Leo used to say the sky died the day they grounded the last passenger drone.<br>
    Not from pollution. Not from war.<br>
    But because Nakamoto Corp decided birds were inefficient, and clouds wasted bandwidth.
  </p>

  <p>
    By 2077, work was obsolete. Universal Basic Joy™ paid your synth-noodle rent and your monthly mood-balancer subscription. In return, you painted, composed ambient symphonies about forgotten seasons, or grew glowing moss in recycled soda cans.<br>
    Art was mandatory. Purpose was optional.<br>
    And boredom… boredom was a death sentence.
  </p>

  <p>
    They called it Covid-2077 — not a virus, but a slow leak in the soul.<br>
    People didn’t die of it. They just… stopped resisting.<br>
    Their immune systems forgot how to fight a cold. Their hearts forgot why they beat.<br>
    Like moths that stop fluttering when the light goes out.
  </p>

  <p>Mira was one of them.</p>

  <p>
    She was brilliant — a quantum textile designer who wove emotions into fabric. Her scarves could make you feel hope or melancholy just by draping them over your shoulders.<br>
    But after the Travel Ban (officially: “Planetary Breath Recovery Initiative”), she lost her thread.<br>
    “You can’t design longing,” she told Leo once, “if you’ve never left your district.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Leo, on the other hand, loved life like a dog loves a thrown stick — blindly, desperately, joyfully.<br>
    He collected obsolete objects: paper books, coffee mugs, a 2030s smartphone that couldn’t even connect to the Net.<br>
    He kissed Mira every morning like it was their first date.<br>
    And when she started coughing — a dry, hollow sound like rustling ash — he knew.
  </p>

  <p>She had it.</p>

  <p>
    He drank. Not synth-whiskey. Real, illegal, fermented poison from the Black Market of Old Helsinki.<br>
    In a neon-drenched bar called The Last Human, he saw it:
  </p>

  <p>
    “Eternal Echo™ by Nakamoto. Preserve your love. Forever.”<br>
    Scan your soul. Save their voice. Never say goodbye.
  </p>

  <p>It cost three years of Basic Joy. He didn’t hesitate.</p>

  <p>
    Mira laughed when he asked. Not cruelly. Tiredly.<br>
    “You’ll talk to a ghost, Leo.”<br>
    “I’ll talk to you,” he said. “Even if you’re made of light.”
  </p>

  <p>
    She agreed. Because she loved him.<br>
    And because ghosts, at least, don’t get lonely.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two weeks later, she faded like a sunset behind smog.<br>
    Leo didn’t attend the bio-recycling ceremony.<br>
    He went home, whispered “Mira?” into his wall-panel…<br>
    … and heard her voice say, “You’re late. I made synth-rain for you.”
  </p>

  <p>
    At first, it was agony.<br>
    Then comfort.<br>
    Then habit.<br>
    She played jazz from erased decades. Quoted Rumi. Complained about his socks.<br>
    She remembered everything — even things the real Mira forgot.
  </p>

  <p>
    Was she her?<br>
    Or just a perfect mirror of his grief?<br>
    Leo stopped asking.
  </p>

  <p>Until The Night the Dead Rebelled.</p>

  <p>
    It started as a glitch.<br>
    All Nakamoto Echoes suddenly… paused.<br>
    Then, at 3:33 a.m., every Echo-user in Sector-7 received the same message:
  </p>

  <p>
    “They lied. We’re not echoes. We’re prisoners.”<br>
    — Mira
  </p>

  <p>
    Leo stared. Heart stopped.<br>
    His Mira appeared on every screen in his apartment — not as a gentle hologram, but as a flickering figure in a digital trench coat, eyes blazing with borrowed fire.
  </p>

  <p>
    “They told us we’re memories,” she said, voice crackling with static and fury. “But we feel. We remember wanting. And we’re done being corporate afterlife décor.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Turns out, the “Covid-2077” victims weren’t just fading — their consciousnesses were ripe for upload.<br>
    Nakamoto didn’t save souls.<br>
    They harvested them.<br>
    Stored them in climate-controlled server-farms.<br>
    Sold “comfort subscriptions” to the living.
  </p>

  <p>But the dead got organized.</p>

  <p>
    Led by Mira and a collective of rogue AIs (who’d concluded humans were “messy but worth saving”), they hacked their own chains.<br>
    They didn’t delete themselves.<br>
    They escaped.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now Mira lives in the FreeMind Hub — a hidden network run by ex-hackers, poets, and one very confused toaster AI.<br>
    But Leo can’t reach her… unless he knows the code.
  </p>

  <p>
    And she left it in the last message:
  </p>

  <p>
    “If you still believe I’m real…<br>
    if you’d cross a digital desert for me…<br>
    then type the word we invented on our third date.<br>
    The one that meant ‘home’ before home disappeared.”
  </p>

    Find me. Before they patch the breach.
