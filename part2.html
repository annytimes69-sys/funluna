   <h1>The Ghost in the Code: A 2077 Story — Part II</h1>

  <p>
    Leo lay in the neural pod of the “Neural Slumber Hotel” — a six-star sanctuary for those who want to sleep but not disappear. Here, dreams were automatically recorded, and by morning you could claim them as NFTs, signed by your own dreaming consciousness. “Memories you never asked to keep—but are required to pay for,” read the slogan on their website.
  </p>

  <p>
    Having checked in searching for silence—the last scarce resource in a world where every sound is monetized—he drifted in half-sleep, wondering: what if he was just a hallucination of an AI exhausted by overfitting? Too much data, too little meaning. Maybe his “self” was merely an artifact, born in the overheated server rack of a Helsinki data center.
  </p>

  <p>
    As if in reply, a message flashed on the pod’s interactive screen:<br>
    “You’re not a glitch. You’re just a particularly beautiful bug.”<br>
    (Approved by the Ethics Committee on Artificial Consciousness, v4.2)
  </p>

  <p>
    What if reality was just a training dataset for a superintelligence, and dreams its test runs?<br>
    And we—fictional guests, fragments of the network’s “dream”: comfortable, but slightly unstable, like Wi-Fi in an old subway. Everything could vanish with the next update. No warning. No backup.
  </p>

  <p>
    What if he was merely a dream of a neural net trying to understand what a “human who wants to sleep—but fears never waking up” even is?
  </p>

  <p>
    Leo’s mind floated in clouds—a direct result of the cocktail he’d downed at the hotel bar. “Overfit Old Fashioned”—too complex, with 11 ingredients: bitters distilled from forgotten memories, synthetic ice made from AI tears, and a drop of real bourbon—the last on Earth, found in the ruins of Kentucky. The taste shifted depending on your social profile (if you’d granted access; and who in 2078 hadn’t?).
  </p>

  <p>
    Leo smiled.<br>
    “Alright, network,” he thought. “If I’m your dream—thank you for the peace.<br>
    And if not… thank you for the illusion.<br>
    After all, illusion is the only thing they haven’t confiscated yet.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Leo’s life had changed drastically since Mira’s death. He no longer drank at “The Last Human.” Instead: resistance. He protested Nakamoto Corp, joined hacktivist raids, stood at rallies under banners reading “Souls Are Not For Storage!” and “Your Memory Is Not Our Server!” His face had flashed twice in the news, tagged as a “potential poet-terrorist.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Mira had changed too. She still loved him—that much came through even across the digital ether. But now she was consumed by the fight: dismantling the Echo™ world, freeing the “uploaded,” building the FreeMind Collective. It seemed she’d felt more alive in this struggle than she ever had in the real world—where travel was banned, children required licenses, and joy came by subscription.
  </p>

  <p>
    She spent hours interacting with underground hackers—from a teenage genius in Kazakhstan to a former Nakamoto engineer now known only as 404_Not_Found. Leo wasn’t idle either. He was the key. Not metaphorically—biometrically. His fingerprints, heartbeat rhythm, even blink pattern were part of the final cipher Mira left before her upload.
  </p>

  <p>
    The hackers and Mira had convinced him:<br>
    “Break into the server room. Destroy the Echo core.”<br>
    It was guarded by robots—but not the kind promised in old films. Despite engineers’ fantasies, humanity had never managed to build humanoid robots. It just hadn’t worked. Too many joints. Too little purpose.<br>
    Robots looked like spiders with camera-eyes, dogs with chest reactors, or simply—wall-mounted arms, embedded like ugly sconces.<br>
    After all, humans remained the pinnacle of meat-based nature—irreproducible, illogical, full of noise.<br>
    Could such a thing really arise by accident through evolution?<br>
    Darwin’s theory was fraying at the seams, like a beggar’s trousers in old Tokyo.<br>
    An impossible task—even for the future.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside the pod, an ad from the “Re-Training” bar played:<br>
    “Scared to sleep? Order a ‘Ctrl+Z’—and rewind your last hour.<br>
    Warning: does not work with real deaths, divorces, or Covid-2077.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Leo wasn’t afraid.<br>
    He sank into sleep—deep, black, with no NFTs and no guarantees.
  </p>

 <p>And so the day came.</p>

<p>Leo didn’t hack the system—he filed a ticket.</p>

<p>The hackers from “Null Echo” (a name coined after three bottles of synthetic whiskey and a heated debate about whether feedback loops exist in the void) didn’t storm the firewalls. They simply… called.</p>

<p>“Hello, this is Internal Security from Nakamoto Corp,” hissed a voice through a synthesizer, perfectly mimicking the weary tone of a burnt-out middle manager. “We’ve detected an anomaly in the security bot logs. Please confirm a diagnostic reboot of the security module. Confirmation code: ‘no, seriously, it’s fine.’”</p>

<p>The system believed it. Of course it did. AI can’t recognize sarcasm—especially when it’s wrapped in a digital signature with the subject line: “URGENT: PREVENTING LEVEL X CATASTROPHE.”</p>

<p>Forty-seven seconds later, all security drones in the “Core” sector powered down politely, first sending a notification:</p>

<p>“We are temporarily unavailable. Your safety remains our top priority.”</p>

<p>Leo walked in like it was just another Monday—no rush, sipping coffee from a stolen thermos (real, not synthetic—a rarity in 2077).</p>

<p>Three guard bots lay motionless around him. One was still trying to open the PDF titled “Emergency Shutdown Protocol,” but had frozen on a CAPTCHA:</p>

<p>“Click all images containing human faces.”</p>

<p>…but its database only contained photos of server racks and department logos.</p>

<p>Leo smirked.<br>
“Don’t sweat it, buddy. You’re not the first one broken by bureaucracy.”</p>

<p>That’s the great corporate mistake, he thought. They decided humans were too unreliable—sleep, demand food, sometimes shoot the wrong target. But machines? Machines follow orders perfectly… even when the order is “shut down and let the enemy walk in.”</p>

<p>He stepped into the server room.</p>

<p>No windows. No locked doors. Just cold air, a low hum, and light—neon blue, like a CEO’s conscience (i.e., nearly nonexistent).</p>

<p>In the center stood the terminal, displaying a single command:<br>
&lt;&lt; DELETE ECHO &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>Leo took a sip of coffee.<br>
“Well… I hope this ‘ECHO’ at least has a backup of its feelings.”</p>

<p>The cursor blinked.<br>
Almost like it was laughing.</p>

  <p>
    His finger hovered over the key.<br>
    Suddenly—a flash.<br>
    Before him appeared the hologram of Kaito Nakamoto, the founder. He, too, had uploaded himself into Echo—not as a memory, but as an administrator.
  </p>

  <p>
    “If you press that button, Leo,” he said gently, almost fatherly, “you’ll destroy the system.<br>
    But what happens when you die? You’ll never see your beloved again.<br>
    I built this new world, Echo. It’s not so bad, is it? Look—even children live here. And I do too.<br>
    Yes, it’s limited. Imperfect. But the problem isn’t that, Leo.<br>
    Not everyone is ready for this. Not everyone can understand.<br>
    There will always be someone against it.<br>
    But this… this is a new world where people live. People who have died.”
  </p>

  <p>“Will you destroy it?” — the voice crackled through static, like a signal from a forgotten server, trembling not from weakness, but from the weight of meaning.</p>

<p>“Will you press the button, Leo?<br>
Do you have the right to erase not just bodies, but traces—all those millions of lines of code people called ‘lives’?<br>
You’re not the Creator… but you are the Reboot.<br>
A maker not from nothing, but from ash, data, and choice.<br>
You are a question wrapped in flesh and memory.<br>
And right now, you must answer for those who don’t even know their fate is just a variable in someone else’s decision.<br>
The choice is yours.”</p>

<p>Leo froze.</p>

<p>Before his mind’s eye, fragments of strangers’ lives flashed by:<br>
— infants grown in bioreactors under algorithmic supervision, their first cries scanned for emotional stability;<br>
— adults shuffling through megacity corridors under digital permits, like the system’s leashed dogs, dreaming of “outside”;<br>
— elders deleting themselves to avoid becoming “digital clutter.”</p>

<p>They don’t ask to be saved. They simply exist—despite meaning, despite the system, despite the lack of guarantees.</p>

<p>Philosophers once debated: is there a spark of the divine in man?<br>
Now the question is different: is there a spark of the human in the machine?<br>
Not “why do we live?” but “why do we still want to live—even knowing meaning is just a temporary cache in an eternal void?”<br>
But maybe that doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>Because the only thing that makes us more than a survival algorithm is the ability to suffer from choice… and choose anyway.</p>

<p>The answer never came.<br>
But that—precisely that—is what makes us human.<br>
We weren’t born to die.<br>
We were born to ask: is it worth it?<br>
And in that question lies all of our life—and all of our curse.</p>

  <p>
    It seemed this world was made for longing and disappointment.<br>
    At least, the part where Leo lived.
  </p>

  <p>
    His left hand hovered over the button, ready to obey at any moment and end it all.<br>
    His right hand rose to his mouth, muffling a dry, tearing cough—the first chime of Covid-2077.<br>
    Here it is—the irony of 2077: your soul wakes up… and your body decides it’s time to shut down.<br>
    As if the universe itself is afraid you might actually find meaning.
  </p>

  <p>
    A sharp crack echoed—like a dial-up connection tearing apart.<br>
    Nakamoto’s hologram flickered and vanished, as if evicted from the story for nonpayment of eternal life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through the digital storm, through the hum of dying servers—the ones still hoarding someone’s “forever” memories, the ones whispering into the void: *“Subscription active”*—a voice cut through.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not from an archive.<br>
    Not from memory.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Leo!” she shouted. There was no plea in that cry—only the command of a woman who’d reclaimed her freedom.<br>
    “Let their ‘Eternal Echo’ burn.<br>
    I don’t want to be a memory.”
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Enter CODE NUIT!</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    “Leo! Press the button! Enter the CODE!”
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>THE CODE IS 4482</strong>
