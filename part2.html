  <p>
    Leo lay in the neural pod of the “Neural Slumber Hotel” — a six-star sanctuary for those who want to sleep but not disappear. Here, dreams were automatically recorded, and by morning you could claim them as NFTs, signed by your own dreaming consciousness. “Memories you never asked to keep—but are required to pay for,” read the slogan on their website.
  </p>

  <p>
    Having checked in searching for silence—the last scarce resource in a world where every sound is monetized—he drifted in half-sleep, wondering: what if he was just a hallucination of an AI exhausted by overfitting? Too much data, too little meaning. Maybe his “self” was merely an artifact, born in the overheated server rack of a Helsinki data center.
  </p>

  <p>
    As if in reply, a message flashed on the pod’s interactive screen:<br>
    “You’re not a glitch. You’re just a particularly beautiful bug.”<br>
    (Approved by the Ethics Committee on Artificial Consciousness, v4.2)
  </p>

  <p>
    What if reality was just a training dataset for a superintelligence, and dreams its test runs?<br>
    And we—fictional guests, fragments of the network’s “dream”: comfortable, but slightly unstable, like Wi-Fi in an old subway. Everything could vanish with the next update. No warning. No backup.
  </p>

  <p>
    What if he was merely a dream of a neural net trying to understand what a “human who wants to sleep—but fears never waking up” even is?
  </p>

  <p>
    Leo’s mind floated in clouds—a direct result of the cocktail he’d downed at the hotel bar. “Overfit Old Fashioned”—too complex, with 11 ingredients: bitters distilled from forgotten memories, synthetic ice made from AI tears, and a drop of real bourbon—the last on Earth, found in the ruins of Kentucky. The taste shifted depending on your social profile (if you’d granted access; and who in 2078 hadn’t?).
  </p>

  <p>
    Leo smiled.<br>
    “Alright, network,” he thought. “If I’m your dream—thank you for the peace.<br>
    And if not… thank you for the illusion.<br>
    After all, illusion is the only thing they haven’t confiscated yet.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Leo’s life had changed drastically since Mira’s death. He no longer drank at “The Last Human.” Instead: resistance. He protested Nakamoto Corp, joined hacktivist raids, stood at rallies under banners reading “Souls Are Not For Storage!” and “Your Memory Is Not Our Server!” His face had flashed twice in the news, tagged as a “potential poet-terrorist.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Mira had changed too. She still loved him—that much came through even across the digital ether. But now she was consumed by the fight: dismantling the Echo™ world, freeing the “uploaded,” building the FreeMind Collective. It seemed she’d felt more alive in this struggle than she ever had in the real world—where travel was banned, children required licenses, and joy came by subscription.
  </p>

  <p>
    She spent hours interacting with underground hackers—from a teenage genius in Kazakhstan to a former Nakamoto engineer now known only as 404_Not_Found. Leo wasn’t idle either. He was the key. Not metaphorically—biometrically. His fingerprints, heartbeat rhythm, even blink pattern were part of the final cipher Mira left before her upload.
  </p>

  <p>
    The hackers and Mira had convinced him:<br>
    “Break into the server room. Destroy the Echo core.”<br>
    It was guarded by robots—but not the kind promised in old films. Despite engineers’ fantasies, humanity had never managed to build humanoid robots. It just hadn’t worked. Too many joints. Too little purpose.<br>
    Robots looked like spiders with camera-eyes, dogs with chest reactors, or simply—wall-mounted arms, embedded like ugly sconces.<br>
    After all, humans remained the pinnacle of meat-based nature—irreproducible, illogical, full of noise.<br>
    Could such a thing really arise by accident through evolution?<br>
    Darwin’s theory was fraying at the seams, like a beggar’s trousers in old Tokyo.<br>
    An impossible task—even for the future.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside the pod, an ad from the “Re-Training” bar played:<br>
    “Scared to sleep? Order a ‘Ctrl+Z’—and rewind your last hour.<br>
    Warning: does not work with real deaths, divorces, or Covid-2077.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Leo wasn’t afraid.<br>
    He sank into sleep—deep, black, with no NFTs and no guarantees.
  </p>

  <p>
    And now, the day had come.<br>
    With the hackers’ help, Leo infiltrated the heart of the corporation—a windowless room bathed in the cold glow of server racks, pulsing like the hearts of dead gods.<br>
    He sat before the main terminal—a monolith of black glass bearing a single command:<br>
    “&lt;&lt; ERASE ECHO &gt;&gt;”
  </p>

  <p>
    His finger hovered over the key.<br>
    Suddenly—a flash.<br>
    Before him appeared the hologram of Kaito Nakamoto, the founder. He, too, had uploaded himself into Echo—not as a memory, but as an administrator.
  </p>

  <p>
    “If you press that button, Leo,” he said gently, almost fatherly, “you’ll destroy the system.<br>
    But what happens when you die? You’ll never see your beloved again.<br>
    I built this new world, Echo. It’s not so bad, is it? Look—even children live here. And I do too.<br>
    Yes, it’s limited. Imperfect. But the problem isn’t that, Leo.<br>
    Not everyone is ready for this. Not everyone can understand.<br>
    There will always be someone against it.<br>
    But this… this is a new world where people live. People who have died.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Will you destroy it?” his voice softened, almost pleading.<br>
    “Will you press that button?<br>
    Do you have the right to decide for others—live or die?<br>
    You are a god now, Leo. God of this world.<br>
    No, you’re not the creator… but you are the shaper.<br>
    The choice is yours.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Leo couldn’t decide.<br>
    Lives flashed before his eyes:<br>
    born—in AI-monitored clinics,<br>
    live—in zones gated by digital passes,<br>
    die—from boredom, silence, the absence of meaning.<br>
    They hope. They wait. They cry in shower stalls where sound isn’t recorded.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many philosophers broke their minds pondering the meaning of meat-based existence.<br>
    But the answer was always obvious—right in front of us:<br>
    We are born to die.<br>
    But god… how badly we want to live.
  </p>

  <p>
    It seemed this world was made for longing and disappointment.<br>
    At least, the part where Leo lived.
  </p>

  <p>
    His left hand hovered over the button, ready to obey at any moment and end it all.<br>
    His right hand rose to his mouth, muffling a dry, tearing cough—the first chime of Covid-2077.<br>
    Here it is—the irony of 2077: your soul wakes up… and your body decides it’s time to shut down.<br>
    As if the universe itself is afraid you might actually find meaning.
  </p>

  <p>
    A sharp crack echoed—like a dial-up connection tearing apart.<br>
    Nakamoto’s hologram flickered and vanished, as if evicted from the story for nonpayment of eternal life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through the digital storm, through the hum of dying servers—the ones still hoarding someone’s “forever” memories, the ones whispering into the void: *“Subscription active”*—a voice cut through.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not from an archive.<br>
    Not from memory.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Leo!” she shouted. There was no plea in that cry—only the command of a woman who’d reclaimed her freedom.<br>
    “Let their ‘Eternal Echo’ burn.<br>
    I don’t want to be a memory.”
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Enter CODE NUIT!</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    “Leo! Press the button! Enter the CODE!”
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>THE CODE IS 5583</strong>
